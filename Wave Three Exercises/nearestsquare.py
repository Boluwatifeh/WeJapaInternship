#Nearest Square
#Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than an integerlimit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

#For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.

limit = 40
number = 0

while (number + 1)**2 < limit:
    number += 1 # write your while loop here
nearest_square = number**2

print(nearest_square)
